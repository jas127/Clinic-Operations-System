# Task 1: Daily Pharmacy Inventory Micro-Audit System

**To:** Clinic Management / Head Doctor  
**From:** Clinic Business Analyst  
**Subject:** Implementation of a 20-Minute Daily Audit Routine for Inventory Accuracy

---

## 1. Executive Summary
This plan introduces a "Micro-Audit" routine designed to catch manual entry errors in the pharmacy before they accumulate into month-end financial losses. By focusing on high-risk items and daily behavior correction, we ensure inventory integrity without disrupting the Doctor’s clinical schedule.

## 2. Identification of High-Risk Medicines
We focus on a "Watch List" to maximize efficiency.

| Medicine (Master Name) | Risk Factor | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dolo 650** | High Volume | High transaction frequency leads to nicknames (e.g., "Dolo", "D-650"). |
| **Azithromycin 500** | Name Ambiguity | Frequently abbreviated as "Azithro," leading to mapping errors. |
| **Pantoprazole 40** | High Frequency | Standard acidity medication; high risk of being missed during peak hours. |

## 3. The Daily Audit Workflow (20–30 Minutes)
*To be performed every morning at 09:00 AM.*

### Phase 1: Data Normalization (10 Mins)
* **Filter:** Extract sales for the High-Risk list from the HMS.
* **Map:** Group variant names into the Master Name (e.g., "Dolo kind" → **Dolo 650**).
* **Action:** Update the Mapping Table with any new abbreviations found.

### Phase 2: The Reasonableness Formula (10 Mins)
* **The Formula:** `(Opening Stock + Purchases) – (Total Sales) = Expected Stock`
* **The Comparison:** Compare **Expected** vs. **Actual Closing Stock**.
* **Flag:** Mark any variance greater than **±2%**.

### Phase 3: Deterrence & Spot Checks (10 Mins)
* Pick **3–5 random bills** involving high-risk medicines.
* Verify if the quantity and name match the prescription intent.

## 4. Sample Audit Tables (Aug 1st Data)

### Table A: Inventory Reconciliation
| Medicine | Opening | Purchased | Sold | Expected | Actual | Variance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dolo 650 | 1,000 | 500 | 30 | 1,470 | 1,440 | **-30** |
| Azithromycin 500 | 300 | 200 | 10 | 490 | 480 | **-10** |

### Table B: Name-Variant Mapping
| Entered Name | Mapped To (Master) | Date First Seen |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dolo | Dolo 650 | Aug 1 |
| Dolo kind | Dolo 650 | Aug 1 |
| Azithro 500 | Azithromycin 500 | Aug 2 |

## 5. Operational Action Rules
* **The 2% Tolerance Rule:** If the difference is < 2%, log it only. If > 2%, investigate trash, return bins, or unbilled prescriptions.
* **The "Repeat Offender" Rule:** If a naming mistake occurs ≥ 3 times/week by the same staff member, they undergo a 5-minute refresher.
* **Escalation Rule:** Doctor is involved **ONLY** if financial loss is material or a pattern persists after two corrections.
